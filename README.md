Hello, there!

This is a bit rework of small project that search for standart spaceships in Conway's game life into zig language.

Requirements: zig

You can build it via this command: zig build-exe main.zig
And also you can "-O ReleaseFast" (without quotes) for building faster program.

Although, nothing is done so far. I have been just messing around with console version of git.
